I am an Associate Professor at Federal University of Pampa in Brazil where I lead the LOS Research Lab.
My research interests cover a broad spectrum of topics in both networks, systems, and optimization. More specifically, Software-Defined Networking, Network Function Virtualization, and Programmable Data Planes. Details of my publications can be found on my Google Scholar profile or my publications page.
I am always looking for motivated students. If you have interests similar to mine, feel free to reach out!
